# WebCrawlerProject
Webscraping the data from the Internet and using Topic modeling to find the relevance between the seeds. The result is visualized using an R shiny app.

I chose https://en.wikipedia.org as the website for web scraping. And by searching the keyword, the website will return a list of the results. The top result is used as input to the Topic Modeling.

The result returned from the Topic Modeling will be used as keyword input for the next search. Finally, the result will be visualized by the network nodes and links.
