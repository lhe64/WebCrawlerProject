Webscraping the data from the Internet and using Topic modeling to find the relevance between the seeds. Presentation using by R shiny app.
I chose www.politico.com as the website to search for web scraping. And by searching the keyword, the website will return 20 articles in the first page which will be later used in topic modeling.

Based on the frequency of the word, it can generate the word cloud and histogram. And it can also give the output from the topic modeling model. The topics number is 4 and it will list top 10 relevance words. These results can be used in the R shiny app.

There is still a issue about  ‘â€œ’  in the output, which need to be fixed later.
